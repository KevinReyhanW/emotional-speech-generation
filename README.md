# Simple Emotional TTS Prototype

This repository contains a small TTS prototype that converts input text into a WAV file and provides simple "emotional" style control.

Deliverables

- `README.md` — setup and usage instructions (this file)

What this implementation does
- Synthesizes speech using Google Text-to-Speech (`gTTS`) for high-quality base audio.
- Applies lightweight emotion simulation by changing playback speed (resampling) using `soundfile` + `numpy`.
  - neutral: baseline
  - happy: faster playback (energetic / enthusiastic)
  - sad: slower playback (subdued)
- Handles invalid input (empty text) and creates output directories when needed.

Why this approach
- I initially tried `pyttsx3` (offline, lightweight) but found it too robotic and limited for emotional expression.
- I experimented with neural TTS libraries (Coqui TTS / Hugging Face models) which offer much better expressivity, but they require heavier dependencies and some packages are not compatible with Python 3.13 (the environment here). To keep the prototype runnable with minimal friction, I chose `gTTS` + resampling:
  - Pros: small install footprint, high base voice quality, works across Python versions, no large model downloads.
  - Cons: emotion is simulated (via speed) rather than generated by a dedicated expressive TTS model.

Setup
1. Python 3.7+ (this script works on modern Python versions; note heavy neural-TTS packages may require <=3.11).
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install gTTS soundfile numpy
```

How to run

Basic (neutral):

```powershell
python solution.py "Hello world" output.wav
```

Happy / enthusiastic:

```powershell
python solution.py "I'm so excited!" happy.wav --style happy
```

Sad:

```powershell
python solution.py "I miss you" sad.wav --style sad
```

Notes on error handling
- Empty text: the script will print an error and exit with a non-zero status.
- Invalid output path: the script will attempt to create parent directories. If it cannot, it prints an error and exits.
